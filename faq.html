                <h2>Wellington</h2>
                <h3>What weather should I expect?</h3>
                Expect it to be rainy or windy most of the time, so don't pack umbrellas, just icebreakers and raincoats. However, you can't beat Wellington on a good day, so also bring a sunhat and lighter clothes in the case of a perfect day.
                <h3>What is the best way to travel around Wellington?</h3>
                In the city, we would recommend taking in the surroundings by walking, as everthing is in close proximity. To travel further outside of Wellington we would recommend to take the electric buses scattered around Wellington, or the trains which are located near the Sky Stadium.
